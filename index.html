            <!-- <p>Every true foodie worth their salt knows that some of the best food in any city can be found on food trucks- 
            but knowing when and where those trucks will be can be next to impossible and discovering new ones often relies 
            on word-of-mouth that is long on tales of delicious, but short on actual details.</p>

            Quickly see all of our Operator partners' nearby food trucks that currently open, 
            view their current real-time GPS location, know the scheduled arrival and departure times, 
            view photos, read customer reviews and much more, all in our easy to use app.
